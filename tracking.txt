Hello I will build a basic API using Django and another technologies: 
-Django REST Framework for API integration.
-Postman for API testing.
-Docker for containerization.
-Git for version controlling.
-PostgreSQL for DB.

In this project I will put in practice some Development technologies and concepts that are required in these days as a good stack to build scalable, maintainable and very efficient projects and well functionalities.
